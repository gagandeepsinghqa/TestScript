# TestScript
I have used DDT framework.
The Test Data will be initialized using an Excel sheet.
You will be needing jars:- JXL, Mail Jars, Selenium latest Jars and ChromeDriver exe to use it.
In Test Data excel , user can either ON or OFF the case. ON will RUN the case and status OFF will not run the case.
User can change the Desired browser on Excel, it will work for three browsers specifically chrome, firefox and IE.
User can find results in Infosys.csv sheet which will be generated after the results are executed.
